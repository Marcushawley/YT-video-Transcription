### :key: Environment Variables
To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`ImageMagick`

`ffmpeg`

`API Keys`



## :toolbox: Getting Started

### :bangbang: Prerequisites

- ffmpeg<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html"> Here</a>
- ImageMagick<a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php"> Here</a>


<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p> First, set-up FFmpeg and ImageMagick packages into the system and save into the environmental variable path in the program to use ffmpeg and ffprobe</p>

<p> Check at the main file where we use these packages into the code must have detected the path of ffmpeg and ffprobe (or else add them manually as done in the setup.py file)</p>

```
ffmpeg_binary =  "/usr/bin/ffmpeg"
   
ffprobe_binary = "/usr/bin//ffprobe"
   
pydub.AudioSegment.ffmpeg = ffmpeg_binary

ffmpeg.input.ffmpeg = ffmpeg_binary

pydub.AudioSegment.ffprobe = ffprobe_binary

ffmpeg.input.ffprobe = ffprobe_binary
```

<p> Or For Streamlit we can add a packages.txt which installs all the required files and setup for the FFmpeg and ImageMagick, It actually automatically runs the command:</p>

```
apt-get install package ( for all the packages in the packages.txt)
```


### :gear: Installation

To use ImageMagick for editing the video with the Moviepy python package we need to allow permissions to read/write to the policy.xml ( as per default policy it is set as none )
```bash
sudo cat /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml | sed 's/none/read,write/g'> /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
```


### :running: Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
https://github.com/manish-4007/YT-video-Transcription
```
Go to the project directory
```bash
cd video_transcriptor
```
Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the environment
```bash
./venv/Scripts/activate
```
Now run the setup.py file to install all the dependencies
```bash
python ./setup.py
```
if still some packages did not installed then run the the requirement.txt using pip
```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
Now all setup done, just run the streamlit file from the terminal to run it in the local server
```bash
streamlit run ./Home.py
```
